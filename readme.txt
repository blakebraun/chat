Simple chat client allowing communication between clients via specified IP address and port number. Server and clients must be run on same address and port number.

Usage: server <IP address> <port number>

client <IP address> <port number>

Client supports two commands: name and quit. Name changes the user name of the client instance, and quit exits the program with a message sent to other users.

For effective communication, run the server and at least two client instances.
